# nodejs-contact_form

This is a contact form to work on a nodejs server.
Some libraries I used for this are express, body-parser, express-handlebars, and nodemailer.

I tested this out using nodemon that will monitor for any changes in your source and automatically restart your server. https://nodemon.io/

I send my emails with nodemailer, is a module for Node.js applications to allow easy as cake email sending. check this link https://nodemailer.com/

In order to get this working as expected you have to indicate your email account sender and password in app.js, line 45-46.

bye, Pura vida!
